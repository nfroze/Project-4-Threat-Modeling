# 🧠 Project 4: Threat Modeling & Incident Response (🚧 In Progress)

## 1. Overview 🚀
This project simulates a full-spectrum **threat modeling workshop** for a fictional cloud-based application. It demonstrates how to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks across a system's architecture using industry-standard methodologies and frameworks.

The goal is to combine architectural thinking, attacker simulation, and security response planning into a single actionable workflow — showcasing how threat modeling fits into the DevSecOps lifecycle.

## 2. Key Methodologies & Frameworks 🧠
- **STRIDE Threat Model** 🔎  
  - Used to assess threats across system components and identify control gaps.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** 🎯  
  - Applied to simulate realistic attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures).
- **Cyber Kill Chain** ⚔️  
  - Maps the end-to-end lifecycle of each attack scenario — from recon to impact.
- **NIST Incident Response** 🚨  
  - Guides the simulation of incident response for at least one modeled attack.

## 3. Threat Modeling Highlights 🔒
- **System Architecture Design**  
  - Includes a full **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** to define components, trust boundaries, and data movement.
- **Inherent Risk Assessment**  
  - Risks are rated by likelihood and impact, with corresponding control recommendations.
- **Multi-Scenario Simulation**  
  - Several distinct attack scenarios are modeled, including phishing, insider threats, ransomware, and web attacks.
- **Mapped Controls & Mitigations**  
  - Each threat is accompanied by actionable security controls (e.g., MFA, RBAC, logging, encryption).

## 4. Workshop Structure & Flow 🔄
1. **Define System Scope & Architecture**  
   - Includes HLD, DFD, and tech stack for a fictional company.
2. **Identify Threats (STRIDE)**  
   - Threats are modeled for each DFD element with control recommendations.
3. **Simulate Attacker Behavior (MITRE & Kill Chain)**  
   - Scenarios use real-world TTPs and lifecycle stages.
4. **Prioritize Risks**  
   - Based on impact and likelihood using a risk matrix.
5. **Simulate Incident Response**  
   - Based on NIST IR framework for one key scenario.
6. **Document Recommendations & Next Steps**  
   - Risk summary and mitigation plan to reduce overall threat exposure.

## 5. Value for Organizations 💼
- **Proactive Risk Reduction**  
  - Identifies and mitigates security gaps before they’re exploited.
- **Realistic Attacker Simulation**  
  - Based on well-known frameworks used across the security industry.
- **Security-by-Design**  
  - Embeds threat modeling and incident planning directly into the architecture phase.
- **Compliance-Ready Documentation**  
  - Includes risk assessments, control mapping, and visual artifacts for auditing.

## 6. Conclusion ✅
This project highlights the strategic value of **threat modeling** as part of the DevSecOps lifecycle. By leveraging STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, and the Cyber Kill Chain, it demonstrates how teams can proactively secure systems through architecture-aware analysis and simulated incident response.

> 📌 The fictional company and scenarios are currently in development. Updates will be published progressively as the workshop is completed.
