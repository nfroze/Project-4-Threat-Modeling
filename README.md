# 🧠 Project 4: Threat Modeling & Incident Response

## 1. Overview 🚀  
This project simulates a full-spectrum **threat modeling workshop** for a fictional cloud-based healthcare platform called **CareConnect360**. Built on modern AWS infrastructure and handling sensitive healthcare data (PII/PHI), the system represents a realistic enterprise attack surface — with authentication flows, real-time video, patient portals, and data exchange across services.

The goal is to demonstrate how to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate security risks across a complex cloud-native architecture using industry-standard frameworks:
- **STRIDE** to analyze trust boundaries and architectural risks  
- **MITRE ATT&CK** to map attacker tactics and techniques  
- **Cyber Kill Chain** to simulate attack progression  
- **NIST Incident Response** to build a structured playbook

This project combines architectural thinking, attacker simulation, and security response planning — showcasing where **threat modeling fits into the DevSecOps lifecycle.**

## 2. Key Deliverables 📦

- **HLD & DFD Diagrams**  
  To map out CareConnect360’s high-level architecture and data flow across trust boundaries

- **Threat Modeling Scenarios**  
  Simulated attacks include:
  - Ransomware on internal systems
  - Insider privilege abuse (S3 bucket exfiltration)
  - SQL Injection on the patient portal

- **Attacker Mapping & Risk Frameworks**  
  Each scenario is fully mapped across:
  - STRIDE Threat Model  
  - MITRE ATT&CK Framework  
  - Cyber Kill Chain stages  
  - Inherent Risk Summary (likelihood × impact)

- **Incident Response Simulation**  
  A NIST-aligned playbook based on the ransomware attack scenario.
