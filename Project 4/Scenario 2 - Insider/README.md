# üéØ Scenario 2: Insider Threat ‚Äì S3 Data Exfiltration

This scenario simulates a malicious insider attack targeting CareConnect360‚Äôs sensitive patient records. An employee with legitimate access to AWS resources exfiltrates large volumes of data from S3 buckets.

The goal is to highlight risks posed by internal actors with elevated permissions and demonstrate how access misuse can bypass perimeter defenses.

## 2. üîÅ Attack Flow Summary

1. Insider logs into AWS environment with valid IAM user credentials  
2. Navigates to S3 buckets containing PII/PHI data  
3. Downloads large amounts of sensitive patient records  
4. Transfers data to external personal storage  
5. Leaves organization or sells/exposes data

## 6. üìä Risk Assessment Summary

| Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Notes                                                  |
|------------|--------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Medium     | High   | High       | Insider risks are difficult to detect and highly damaging |

*See: [Risk Summary.md](./Risk%20Summary.md)*

---

## 7. üßØ Mitigation & Response Plan

### üîê Prevention
- Enforce strict IAM least privilege
- Mandatory access reviews and approval workflows
- Segregate access based on job role

### üîç Detection
- Enable CloudTrail logging for all S3 API calls
- Monitor for unusual download patterns
- Use anomaly detection via GuardDuty or SIEM

### üö® Response
- Suspend compromised IAM credentials
- Notify compliance teams and legal (HIPAA implications)
- Forensic analysis and user access review
- Update security policies to close control gaps
