# üéØ Scenario 3: SQL Injection on Patient Portal

This scenario simulates a SQL Injection (SQLi) attack targeting the public-facing patient portal of CareConnect360. The attacker exploits poor input validation to exfiltrate sensitive backend data via unauthenticated access.

The goal is to demonstrate how a single overlooked validation flaw can lead to significant data compromise ‚Äî even from outside the organization.

## 1. üë§ Threat Actor Profile

| Type             | Description                                 | Motivation       | Access Level     |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| External Attacker | Unauthenticated user exploiting web input  | Financial gain or notoriety | None (public access) |

---

## 2. üîÅ Attack Flow Summary

1. Attacker discovers injectable input field on the patient portal  
2. Sends specially crafted SQL payload via login or search form  
3. Backend query returns unauthorized data (e.g., patient records)  
4. Attacker escalates the injection to enumerate full database  
5. Exfiltrates data and attempts to cover tracks

## 7. üßØ Mitigation & Response Plan

### üîê Prevention
- Implement strong input validation and prepared statements
- Apply WAF rules to block malicious input patterns
- Sanitize all user-supplied data before executing queries

### üîç Detection
- Monitor application logs for unusual input patterns
- Alert on large/unusual SELECT queries from unauthenticated users
- Use DAST tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) for regular scanning

### üö® Response
- Block offending IPs at the WAF level
- Rotate database credentials and review access logs
- Conduct post-incident forensic analysis
- Patch vulnerable input points and push hotfix immediately
